# 💻 Computational & Programming Skills

With a strong foundation in chemical engineering and computational science, I bring over **7 years of hands-on experience in Python programming**, paired with a deep understanding of algorithm design, simulation, and applied machine learning. My work bridges the gap between **scientific modeling** and **modern AI technologies**, enabling me to build, test, and deploy data-driven solutions across multiple domains.

## 🧠 Key Skills & Tools

- **Programming Languages**:  
  Python (primary) · MATLAB · Bash · Basic C/C++ · JavaScript (for web integration)

- **Scientific & Analytical Tools**:  
  Molecular Dynamics (LAMMPS, NAMD) · DPD Simulation · Density Functional Theory (DFT) · Computational Modeling · Data Analysis

- **AI & Machine Learning**:  
  Experience with ML pipelines, data annotation, model training, and evaluation. Skilled in scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, and Jupyter-based analysis.

- **Workflow & Version Control**:  
  Regular GitHub user for code versioning, collaborative development, and project documentation.

- **Teaching & Mentorship**:  
  Trained students in Python and machine learning techniques during academic appointments. Developed reproducible research scripts and teaching notebooks.

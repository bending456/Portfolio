## ðŸ“˜ Early Research â€“ Molecular Simulation & Materials Chemistry

In the early days of my scientific journey, I was not just running simulationsâ€”I was decoding the invisible. As a Ph.D. candidate, I used molecular dynamics and DFT not merely as tools, but as a microscope into the molecular soul of complex systems.

Whether it was surfactants assembling into micelles, carboxylates gripping mineral surfaces, or stress morphing a polymer membrane, I didn't just study matterâ€”I translated its language. From reverse osmosis membranes to soft nanoreactors, I architected simulations that optimized materials from the atom up.

This era established my foundation in multiscale modeling, molecular-level intuition, and algorithmic thinking, laying the groundwork for everything that followed.


- Conducted extensive **molecular dynamics (MD)** and **density functional theory (DFT)** simulations to study the structure, energetics, and interaction of soft matter systems.

## ðŸ“˜ Early Research â€“ Molecular Simulation & Materials Chemistry

In the early days of my scientific journey, I was not just running simulationsâ€”I was decoding the invisible. As a Ph.D. candidate, I used molecular dynamics and DFT not merely as tools, but as a microscope into the molecular soul of complex systems.

Whether it was surfactants assembling into micelles, carboxylates gripping mineral surfaces, or stress morphing a polymer membrane, I didn't just study matterâ€”I translated its language. From reverse osmosis membranes to soft nanoreactors, I architected simulations that optimized materials from the atom up.

This era established my foundation in multiscale modeling, molecular-level intuition, and algorithmic thinking, laying the groundwork for everything that followed.


- Conducted extensive **molecular dynamics (MD)** and **density functional theory (DFT)** simulations to study the structure, energetics, and interaction of soft matter systems.
- Investigated **SDS micelle stability**, **water penetration**, and **surfactant dissociation mechanisms** in aqueous environments.  
  *(Chun et al., 2015 â€“ Colloids and Surfaces A)*
- Explored **carboxylate adsorption** on **calcium carbonate surfaces** relevant to **biomineralization** and **surface chemistry**.  
  *(Chun et al., 2015 â€“ Colloids and Surfaces A)*
- Characterized **uniaxial deformation effects** on **hydrated Nafion membranes**, connecting mechanical stress to ion transport behavior.  
  *(Abu-Hakmeh et al., 2015 â€“ MPC)*
- Modeled the **interaction of epoxides and diols** with **poly(2-oxazoline)-based micelles** using **Floryâ€“Huggins theory**.  
  *(Chun et al., 2015 â€“ PCCP)*
- Applied **DPD coarse-grained simulation** to analyze **multicompartment micelles** functioning as nanoreactors.  
  *(Chun et al., 2016 â€“ PCCP)*
- Early work on **membrane fouling prevention** via **polydopamine (PDA) deposition** contributed to optimization of ultrafiltration and RO membranes.

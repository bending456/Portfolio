## ðŸ§  Biomedical Modeling â€“ Neuroinflammation & Immunology

With a solid simulation arsenal in hand, I pivoted from passive materials to active biology. The brainâ€”its cells, its chaos, its signalsâ€”became my next frontier. I began engineering computational models of microglial calcium signaling, purinergic receptor networks, and inflammatory pathways, translating bioelectric noise into algorithmic order.

I wasnâ€™t just interpreting experimental dataâ€”I was predicting what would happen next. My work dissected how ATP pulses ignite immune responses, how diet reshapes inflammation, and how molecular crowding in synapses distorts even the most fundamental signaling mechanisms.

This chapter of my career defined me as a systems thinker in biology, where my engineering mindset met the eleganceâ€”and messinessâ€”of the immune and nervous systems. I wasn't just modeling biologyâ€”I was reshaping how we understand it.

- Developed computational models of **P2X-mediated calcium signaling in microglia**, capturing ATP-triggered waveforms and cellular response.  
  *(Chun et al., 2019 â€“ Journal of Physiology)*  
- Simulated **purinergic receptor activation** (P2X/P2Y) and **ectonucleotidase activity (CD39/CD73)** to explore signal transduction in **neuronal synapses** and **immune cells**.  
  *(Kekenes-Huskey et al., 2019; Rahmaninejad et al., 2022 â€“ Biophysical Journal)*
- Modeled **cytokine production** in **macrophages** stimulated by **LPS and ATP**, integrating receptor dynamics with transcriptional response.  
  *(Chun et al., 2020 â€“ Biophysical Journal)*
- Investigated **diet-induced inflammation** using biosensor mouse models, highlighting **sex- and tissue-specific immune responses** to Western diets.  
  *(Talley et al., 2022 â€“ Disease Models & Mechanisms)*
- Demonstrated how **receptor architecture** and **LPS O-antigen shielding** influence **antibody accessibility** to *Salmonella* surfaces.  
  *(DomÃ­nguez-Medina et al., 2020 â€“ Nature Communications)*
- Most recent work dissected how **CD39 activity** sculpts ATP-mediated calcium signals in microglia, modulating activation dynamics.  
  *(Chun et al., 2023 â€“ Frontiers in Physiology)*

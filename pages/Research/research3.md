## ⚙️ Additional Topics & Interdisciplinary Threads

Beyond the formal stages, there’s always been a shadow arc in my work—projects born of curiosity, opportunity, and intellectual play. I’ve simulated DNA under force, explored antibody access in bacterial envelopes, and even built hybrid mechanical-biochemical systems to track disease at the molecular scale.

This "everything else" isn't filler—it's where new domains collide. It's the incubation zone for big ideas and unconventional questions.

In every odd corner of this work lies the same philosophy: don’t just model what exists—simulate what could be.

- Studied **mechanical deformation** of **dsDNA** under force, modeling stress-induced structural transitions relevant to nanotechnology.  
  *(Hwang et al., 2014 – ACS Abstracts)*
- Combined **molecular crowding**, **enzyme kinetics**, and **neuronal geometry** to explore how physical constraints alter signaling efficiency.
- Across all stages of research, integrated **high-performance computing** (e.g., TACC Stampede), **data-driven modeling**, and **Python-based scientific programming**.
